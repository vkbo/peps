<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP provides an overview of the selection process for a new model of
Python language governance in the wake of <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html">Guido’s retirement</a>.
Once the governance model is selected, it will be codified in <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0013">PEP 13</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of PEPs related to the governance model selection process.
PEPs in the lower 8000s describe the general process for selecting a
governance model.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8001">PEP 8001</a> - Python Governance Voting Process<p>This PEP describes how the vote for the new governance model will be
conducted.  It outlines the voting method, timeline, criteria for
participation, and explicit list of eligible voters.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8002">PEP 8002</a> - Open Source Governance Survey<p>Surveys will be conducted of governance models for similar open source and
free software projects, and summaries of these models will be outlined in
this PEP.  These surveys will serve as useful barometers for how such
projects can be successfully governed, and may serve as inspiration for
Python’s own governance model.  Python is unique, so it’s expected that it
will have its own spin on governance, rather than directly adopting any of
those surveyed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PEPs in the 801Xs describe the actual proposals for Python governance.  It is
expected that these PEPs will cover the broad scope of governance, and that
differences in details (such as the size of a governing council) will be
covered in the same PEP, rather than in potentially vote-splitting individual
PEPs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8010">PEP 8010</a> - The Technical Leader Governance Model<p>This PEP proposes a continuation of the singular technical project
leader model.  Also within scope is whether an advisory council aids
or supports the BDFL.  This PEP does <em>not</em> name either the next
BDFL, nor members of such an advisory council.  For that, see <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0013">PEP
13</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8011">PEP 8011</a> - Python Governance Model Lead by Trio of Pythonistas<p>This PEP describes a new model of Python governance lead by a Trio of Pythonistas
(TOP).  It describes the role and responsibilities of the Trio.
This PEP does <em>not</em> name members of the Trio.  For that, see <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0013">PEP 13</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8012">PEP 8012</a> - The Community Governance Model<p>This is a placeholder PEP for a new model of Python governance based on
consensus and voting, without the role of a centralized singular leader or a
governing council.  It describes how, when, and why votes are conducted for
decisions affecting the Python language.  It also describes the criteria for
voting eligibility.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8013">PEP 8013</a> - The External Governance Model<p>This PEP describes a new model of Python governance based on an external
council who are responsible for ensuring good process.  Elected by the core
development team, this council may reject proposals that are not
sufficiently detailed, do not consider all affected users, or are not
appropriate for the upcoming release.  This PEP does <em>not</em> name members of
such a council.  For that, see <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0013">PEP 13</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8014">PEP 8014</a> - The Commons Governance Model<p>This PEP describes a new model of Python governance based on a council of
elders who are responsible for ensuring a PEP is supported by a sufficient
majority of the Python community before being accepted. Unlike some of the
other governance PEPs it explicitly does <em>not</em> specify who has voting
rights and what a majority vote consists of. In stead this is determined
by the council of elders on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8015">PEP 8015</a> - Organization of the Python community<p>This PEP formalizes the current organization of the Python community
and proposes 3 main changes: formalize the existing concept of
“Python teams”; give more autonomy to Python teams; replace the BDFL
(Guido van Rossum) with a new “Python board” of 3 members which has
limited roles, mostly decide how a PEP is approved (or rejected).</p>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pep-8016">PEP 8016</a> - The Steering Council Model<p>This PEP proposes a model of Python governance based around a
steering council. The council has broad authority, which they seek
to exercise as rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to
establish standard processes, like those proposed in the other
801x-series PEPs.  This follows the general philosophy that it’s
better to split up large changes into a series of small changes that
can be reviewed independently: instead of trying to do everything in
one PEP, we focus on providing a minimal-but-solid foundation for
further governance decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional governance models may be added before the final selection.</p>
